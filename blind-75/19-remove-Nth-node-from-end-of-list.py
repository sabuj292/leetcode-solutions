    # Approach: Two Pointer Technique
    """
    Idea:
Use two pointers, fast and slow.

Steps:
Move fast n steps ahead

Now move fast and slow together until fast hits the end

Now, slow is at the node just before the one we want to remove

Skip the next node: slow.next = slow.next.next
    """
    
"""
ðŸ”“ Summary (Memory Trigger)
Move fast ahead n steps â†’ maintain distance
Move both together until fast.next = None
Now slow is exactly before the node to remove â†’ delete it.
