# Problem Solving Approach: Expand around the center

There are two kinds of centers:

    Centers on a character â€” for odd-length palindromes

    Centers between characters â€” for even-length palindromes

Possible positions:

    ðŸ‘‰ Odd-length centers (on characters):
Center on a (index 0)

Center on b (index 1)

Center on c (index 2)

And for any string of length n, this pattern always happens:

n odd-length centers

n - 1 even-length centers
